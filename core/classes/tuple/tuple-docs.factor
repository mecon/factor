ARTICLE: "parametrized-constructors" "Parameterized constructors"
"A " { $emphasis "parametrized constructor" } " is a word which directly or indirectly calls " { $link construct-empty } " or " { $link construct-boa } ", but instead of passing a literal class symbol, it takes the class symbol as an input from the stack."
$nl
"Parametrized constructors are useful in many situations, in particular with subclassing. For example, consider the following code:"
{ $code
    "TUPLE: vehicle max-speed occupants ;"
    ""
    ": add-occupant ( person vehicle -- ) occupants>> push ;"
    ""
    "TUPLE: car < vehicle engine ;"
    ": <car> ( max-speed engine -- car )"
    "    car construct-empty"
    "        V{ } clone >>occupants"
    "        swap >>engine"
    "        swap >>max-speed ;"
    ""
    "TUPLE: aeroplane < vehicle max-altitude ;"
    ": <aeroplane> ( max-speed max-altitude -- aeroplane )"
    "    aeroplane construct-empty"
    "        V{ } clone >>occupants"
    "        swap >>max-altitude"
    "        swap >>max-speed ;"
}
"The two constructors depend on the implementation of " { $snippet "vehicle" } " because they are responsible for initializing the " { $snippet "occupants" } " slot to an empty vector. If this slot is changed to contain a hashtable instead, there will be two places instead of one. A better approach is to use a parametrized constructor for vehicles:"
{ $code
    "TUPLE: vehicle max-speed occupants ;"
    ""
    ": add-occupant ( person vehicle -- ) occupants>> push ;"
    ""
    ": construct-vehicle ( class -- vehicle )"
    "    construct-empty"
    "        V{ } clone >>occupants ;"
    ""
    "TUPLE: car < vehicle engine ;"
    ": <car> ( max-speed engine -- car )"

"By convention, construction logic is encapsulated in a word named after the tuple class surrounded in angle brackets; for example, the constructor word for a " { $snippet "point" } " class might be named " { $snippet "<point>" } "."
$nl
"All tuple construction should be done through constructor words, and construction primitives should be encapsulated and never called outside of the vocabulary where the class is defined, because this encourages looser coupling.

"Tuple subclassing should only be used for " { $emphasis "is-a" } " relationships; for example, a car " { $emphasis "is a" } " vehicle, and a circle " { $emphasis "is a" } " shape."
{ $heading "Anti-pattern #1: subclassing for has-a" }
"Subclassing should not be used for " { $emphasis "has-a" } " relationships. For example, if a shape " { $emphasis "has a" } " color, then " { $snippet "shape" } " should not subclass " { $snippet "color" } ". Using tuple subclassing in inappropriate situations leads to code which is more brittle and less flexible than it should be."
$nl
"For example, suppose that " { $snippet "shape" } " inherits from " { $snippet "color" } ":"
{ $code
    "TUPLE: color r g b ;"
    "TUPLE: shape < color ... ;"
}
"Now, the implementation of " { $snippet "shape" } " depends on a specific representation of colors as RGB colors. If a new generic color protocol is devised which also allows HSB and YUV colors to be used, the shape class will not be able to take advantage of them without changes. A better approach is to store the color in a slot:"
{ $code
    "TUPLE: rgb-color r g b ;"
    "TUPLE: hsv-color h s v ;"
    "..."
    "TUPLE: shape color ... ;"
}
"The " { $vocab-link "delegate" } " library provides a language abstraction for expressing has-a relationships."
{ $heading "Anti-pattern #2: subclassing for implementation sharing only" }
"Tuple subclassing purely for sharing implementations of methods is not a good idea either. If a class " { $snippet "A" } " is a subclass of a class " { $snippet "B" } ", then instances of " { $snippet "A" } " should be usable anywhere that an instance of " { $snippet "B" } " is. If this properly does not hold, then subclassing should not be used."
$nl
"There are two alternatives which are preferred to subclassing in this case. The first is " { $link "mixins" } "."
$nl
"The second is to use ad-hoc slot polymorphism. If two classes define a slot with the same name, then code which uses " { $link "accessors" } " can operate on instances of both objects, assuming the values stored in that slot implement a common protocol. This allows code to be shared without creating contrieved relationships between classes."
{ $heading "Anti-pattern #3: subclassing to override a method definition" }
"While method overriding is a very powerful tool, improper use can cause tight coupling of code and lead to difficulty in testing and refactoring. Subclassing should not be used as a means of ``monkey patching'' methods to fix bugs and add features. Only subclass from classes which were designed to be inherited from, and when writing classes of your own which are intended to be subclassed, clearly document that subclasses may and may not do. This includes construction policy; document whether subclasses should use " { $link construct-empty } ", " { $link construct-boa } ", or a custom parametrized constructor."
