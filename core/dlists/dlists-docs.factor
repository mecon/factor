ARTICLE: "dlists" "Doubly-linked lists"
"A doubly-linked list, or dlist, is a list of nodes. Each node has a link to the previous and next nodes, and a slot to store an object."
$nl
"While nodes can be modified directly, the fundamental protocol support by doubly-linked lists is that of a double-ended queue with a few additional operations. Elements can be added or removed at both ends of the dlist in constant time."
$nl
"When using a dlist as a simple queue, the convention is to queue elements with " { $link push-front } " and dequeue them with " { $link pop-back } "."
