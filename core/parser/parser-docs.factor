"The Factor parser is follows a simple recursive-descent design. The parser reads successive tokens from the input; if the token identifies a number or an ordinary word, it is added to an accumulator vector.

"Parsing words are marked by suffixing the definition with a " { $link POSTPONE: parsing } " declaration. Here is the simplest possible parsing word; it prints a greeting at parse time:"
